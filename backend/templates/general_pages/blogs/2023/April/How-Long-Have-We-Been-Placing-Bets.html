                  Sports betting boasts a rich and intriguing history that spans thousands of years. 
                  From ancient civilizations to the present day, sports betting has been an integral part of 
                  <a href="https://thefrisky.com/history-of-gambling/">
                    cultures across the globe
                  </a>.
                  However, residents of Missouri still need to travel to neighboring states to partake in this age-old tradition.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Betting in Ancient Times
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                  The roots of sports betting can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of wagers placed on events such as chariot races and gladiator games in Ancient Rome. 
                  In Greece, people bet on the Olympic Games, held every four years from 776 BC to 393 AD. Additionally, there are records of sports betting on dragon boat races and cricket fights dating back to the Han Dynasty in China. 
                  As time progressed, sports betting persisted in popularity, with wagers placed on events like jousting tournaments, cockfights, and horse racing. 
                  The more modern style of betting 
                  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25096480">
                    emerged in England
                  </a>
                  as horse racing gained popularity, and by the 18th century, it had become one of the nation's favorite pastimes.

                <h3>
                  The Cultural Significance of Sports Betting
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Historians believe that sports betting has played a crucial role in societies throughout history as a form of entertainment, socialization, and competition. 
                  By promoting sports betting, event organizers could draw larger crowds and increase interest in their games, benefiting the local economy. 
                  For example, the Olympic Games attracted spectators and participants from all over Greece and beyond, boosting the sale of goods and services, such as food, lodging, and transportation. 
                  Furthermore, sports betting exposed younger generations to new physical activities and diverse cultures.

                <h3>
                  Notable Successes in Sports Betting
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Over the years, sports betting has seen its share of success stories. 
                  In 1913, a man named John Spann won over $17,000 (equivalent to over $400,000 today) by betting on a horse named 
                    <a href="https://www.champsofthetrack.com/post/donerail-91-1-longshot-kentucky-derby-winner">
                      Donerail to win the Kentucky Derby at odds of 91-1
                    </a>
                  . More recently, the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV in 2020, with several substantial bets placed on the game. 
                  One such bet was placed at the Mirage Sportsbook in Las Vegas, where a bettor wagered $2.3 million on the Chiefs to win the game outright, earning a payout of $2.1 million.
                </p>
                
                <h3>
                  The Future of Sports Betting
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                  In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA, the legislation making sports betting illegal in the US, was unconstitutional, effectively overturning the 25-year ban. 
                  While the industry is still in its early stages, it has already had a significant impact on the US sports landscape. 
                  As more states legalize sports betting, the industry is expected to grow and evolve, offering new products and services to sports enthusiasts and bettors alike. 
                  Regardless of whether sports betting is viewed as a game of chance or skill, its rich history and cultural influence are undeniable, let's hope Missouri does not fall behind.
