      Is Sports Betting Legal in Missouri?
    </h1>
    <h2>
      In short, no. Efforts to legalize sports betting in Missouri have, unfortunately, stalled in the State Senate for the last several years.

        Now, in the absence of any other strategy, it's up to us (that's all of us, Missouri Sports Bettors) to let our lawmakers know: We want them to legalize sports betting NOW. Enough is enough. You can help by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Being vocal. It can be as easy as a brief comment on Twitter, or as intensive as hand-writing a letter to your Missouri legislators. Every little bit helps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Spreading the word! Sports fans hang out with other sports fans. If your friends support the sports betting legalization effort, let them know to get involved by subscribing to the Let MO Play Missouri Sports Betting newsletter or following Let MO Play on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Keep playing. Whether you make the trek to Illinois, Kansas, or one of the 5 other states bordering Missouri that have legalized sports betting, keep it up! Our lawmakers don't care about much, but if they see money leaving our state, maybe, just maybe, they'll change their tune.
        </li>

        The potential future legalization of sports betting in Missouri brings with it the concerns of problem gambling, or gamlbing addiction. At Let MO Play, we recognize sports betting can lead to problem gambling in certain individuals, and we believe that legalization is the best way to ensure that these individuals have access to the appropriate treatment. At Let MO Play, we believe that gambling of any type, sports betting or otherwise, should be done responsibly. However, if you, or someone you know, has a gambling problem, call 888-BETSOFF(238-7633).
